# IntroductoryPhysics

People have written more eloquently than I can about this (e.g Chanda Prescod-Weinstein's 
[Decolonising Science Reading
List](https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f#.3yyou2as5)). It
is certainly true, for instance, that  working through a common
syllabus with a standard textbook will have intro students looking at
a progression of Physicists all of whom look like Newton.

As a teacher, I thought "oh, I'll just grab someone else's annotated
syllabus so that I can consistently augment my own class with a more
inclusive (note: now I might say 'decolonised') set of models." I
poked around the internet, but couldn't find such a syllabus. So, as
part of my intro class, one of the assignments is essentially "find an
example of a Physicist who doesn't look like Newton, write something
about that person, include a picture if you can, and figure out where
that person could have been included in our syllabus." We're putting
this on github so that (1) it can be a resource for others (2) people
can send in
[PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to make
this better.

Some details:

* Right now, my class uses Knight's 3rd edition. I'd love a PR to add
  chapters/sections from other texts!
* Comments on organization/structure are welcome.
* I'm likely to have this do double-duty for demos.
* Use the [Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to generate tables easily. It's OK if the formatting gets ugly.
* Use the syntax from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2822089/how-to-link-to-part-of-the-same-document-in-markdown) to link to other sections. Just add a new section under [Models](#models) with each new person, and make a link.

# Models

## Quidong Wang
Quidong Wang, mathematical physicist, found an infinite-series solution to the generalized “n-body” problem, which is important in predicting the motions of planetary systems.
