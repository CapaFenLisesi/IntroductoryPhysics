# IntroductoryPhysics

People have written more eloquently than I can about this (e.g Chanda Prescod-Weinstein's 
[Decolonising Science Reading
List](https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f#.3yyou2as5)). It
is certainly true, for instance, that  working through a common
syllabus with a standard textbook will have intro students looking at
a progression of Physicists all of whom look like Newton.

As a teacher, I thought "oh, I'll just grab someone else's annotated
syllabus so that I can consistently augment my own class with a more
inclusive (note: now I might say 'decolonised') set of models." I
poked around the internet, but couldn't find such a syllabus. So, as
part of my intro class, one of the assignments is essentially "find an
example of a Physicist who doesn't look like Newton, write something
about that person, include a picture if you can, and figure out where
that person could have been included in our syllabus." We're putting
this on github so that (1) it can be a resource for others (2) people
can send in
[PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to make
this better.

Some details:

* Right now, my class uses Knight's 3rd edition. I'd love a PR to add
  chapters/sections from other texts!
* Comments on organization/structure are welcome.
* I'm likely to have this do double-duty for demos.
* Use the [Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to generate tables easily. It's OK if the formatting gets ugly.

* Make a new section under [Models](#models) below for each new person. Title it with their name, including spaces. You can then link to that section with the following syntax: for Emmy Noether, use:

# Models

## Qiudong Wang
Qiudong Wang, mathematical physicist, found an infinite-series solution to the generalized “n-body” problem, which is important in predicting the motions of planetary systems.

## Zhang Heng
Zhang Heng, astronomer, mathematician, inventor and poet in China’s Han Dynasty (78-139 C.E.).  Invented the world’s first seismometer (for detecting earthquakes), improved the water clock, and developed a water-powered instrument to help measure the positions of stars and planets.

## Henrietta Swan Leavitt
Henrietta Swan Leavitt, whose job was documenting the characteristics of “Cephid variable” stars in the early 1900’s, before computers were available to do such work.  These stars have a brightness that varies with a stable period, and Henrietta’s job was to look at photographic plates that contained images such variable stars. In the process of examining over 1700 images of stars in a nearby galaxy, she discovered an important regularity between the brightness of such stars and the period of the variation of the star.  That discovery let scientists determine the distance to other galaxies, which helped lead to the discovery that the universe is expanding.

## Dr. Sandra Faber
Dr. Sandra Faber, an astronomer who (along with Dr. Robert Jackson) develop the Faber-Jackson relation, which established a relation between the brightness of stars in a galaxy and that galaxy’s distance from earth.  This relation takes into account the “tilt” of the galaxy with respect to the line of sight from the earth to that galaxy.  She also designed the Keck observatory on Mauna Kea, a mountain in Hawaii.

## Richard Feynman
Richard Feynman, a US theoretical Physicist who developed the mathematical technique used to make quantum predictions in fundamental particle physics.  

## Whisoh Lee
Whisoh Lee, a Korean theoretical physicist worked on fundamental particle physics, and whose work influenced Abdus Salam’s work on electro-weak theory as well as the developing the basis for the Higg’s mechanism.

## Abdus Salam
Abdus Salam– Pakistani theoretical physicist, earned the Nobel Prize in 1979 for his work unifying electromagnetism with the weak interaction (responsible for “beta decay” of radioactive elements).

## Chen-Ning Yang
Chen-Ning Yang, theoretical Physicist.  Born in China and educated there and in Chicago, he and collaborator Tsung-dao Lee laid the theoretical foundation for a model that predicted that the supposed “conservation of Parity” law is violated in nuclear beta decay, an important step toward the development of the “standard model” for particle physics.  He and Lee shared the Nobel Prize in 1957.

## Chien-Shiun Wu
Chien-Shiun Wu, experimental Physicist.  Born in China and educated at Nanking University and UC Berkeley, she helped develop the process of separating Uranium into its two isotope (235 and 238), only one of which (235) can be used in nuclear fission.  She later became an expert in beta decay.  Yang and Lee asked her to study the radioactive decay of Co-60, and her results verified the “Yang-Lee” theory,  thus disproving the supposed “conservation of Parity” in beta decay.  

## Emmy Noether
Why did nobody pick her yet?
