In the lab, she records \"some of the fastest motions in our natural world.\" Her lasers can capture the movement of electrons. Her newest laser and x-ray beams can flash for less than 0.00000000000000001 seconds. Talk about \"in the blink of an eye!\" She is able to pass on excitement and knowledge to students.
